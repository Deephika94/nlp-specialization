    "Welcome to this week's programming assignment on exploring word vectors.\n",
    "In natural language processing, we represent each word as a vector consisting of numbers.\n",
    "The vector encodes the meaning of the word. These numbers (or weights) for each word are learned using various machine\n",
    "learning models, which we will explore in more detail later in this specialization. Rather than make you code the\n",
    "machine learning models from scratch, we will show you how to use them. In the real world, you can always load the\n",
    "trained word vectors, and you will almost never have to train them from scratch. In this assignment, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict analogies between words.\n",
    "- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the word embeddings and plot them in two dimensions.\n",
    "- Compare word embeddings by using a similarity measure (the cosine similarity).\n",

    "In the lectures, we have illustrated the word analogies\n",
    "by finding the capital of a country from the country. \n",
    "We have changed the problem a bit in this part of the assignment. You are asked to predict the **countries** \n",
    "that corresponds to some **capitals**.\n",
    "You are playing trivia against some second grader who just took their geography test and knows all the capitals by heart.\n",
    "Thanks to NLP, you will be able to answer the questions properly. In other words, you will write a program that can give\n",
    "you the country by its capital. That way you are pretty sure you will win the trivia game. We will start by exploring the data set.\n",

    "Euclidean distance between the original vectors and their projected siblings is\n",
    "minimal. Hence vectors that were originally close in the embeddings dictionary,\n",
    "will produce lower dimensional vectors that are still close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that when you map out the words, similar words will be clustered\n",
    "next to each other. For example, the words 'sad', 'happy', 'joyful' all describe\n",
    "emotion and are supposed to be near each other when plotted.\n",
    "The words: 'oil', 'gas', and 'petroleum' all describe natural resources.\n",
